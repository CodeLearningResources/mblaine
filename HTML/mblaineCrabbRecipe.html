	<h2 class="ingredients:">Ingredients:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 lb. jumbo lump or backfin crab meat</li>
		<li>2 slices bread or bread crumbs</li>
		<li>1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</li>
		<li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
		<li>2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</li>
		<li>1 tbsp. snipped parsley </li>
		<li>1 egg (or substitute for special diets)</li>
		<li>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</li>

	<h2 class="directions:">Directions:</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>Beat the egg in a bowl. </li>
	<li>Trim the crusts from the bread and break the slices into small pieces. Add these pieces to the egg. </li>
	<li>Mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Chesapeake seasoning and parsley, and beat well.</li>
	<li>Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. </li>
	<li>Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</li>
	<li>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. 
		Shape should be like a cookie, not like a meatball or golf ball. </li>
	<li>Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. 
		This is very important so the cakes don't fall apart.</li>
