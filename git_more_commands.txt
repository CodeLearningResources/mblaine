Git Hub

Step 0: this should have ben completed last week when you signed up on github and created your own repository
mine was created as https://github.com/pegblaine

I have 7 different repositories now:
1. advanced_data_analytics
2. adv_data_analytics
3. mblaine - from DA 5-week class
4. ImmersiveData - from the DA boot camp (4-day) class (see subfolder Final_Project for both DC_Properties pythin file and tableau workbook)
5. mblaine_project_1 - See subfolder Project1 for all files related to DA 5-week project 1 files.
6. mblaine_week1 - this has the DC_Properties.ipynb file from the DA boot camp (4-day) class.
7. week_1


Since we changed classrooms, I never created a local mblaine git repository for my existing https://github.com/pegblaine user space and mblaine repository

So https://github.com/pegblaine in NOT a REPO but it contains the 7 repositories I've created using the GIT GUI


As a first test:

Under C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents (mblaine folder already exists here)

created pegblaine folder
ran the following 2 git commands to set user name and email address

C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine> git config --global user.name "pegblaine"
C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine> git config --global user.email mblaine1@montgomerycollege.edu

created pegblaine\adv_data_analytics folder

cd .\adv_data_analytics\

Now ran more git commands to pull existing repo to this local folder

C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine\adv_data_analytics> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/GBTC406003ur/Documents/pegblaine/adv_data_analytics/.git/

C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine\adv_data_analytics> git remote add origin https://github.com/pegblaine/adv_data_analytics

Check/view remote URL 

C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine\adv_data_analytics> git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/pegblaine/adv_data_analytics (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/pegblaine/adv_data_analytics (push)

That looks right so pull repository

C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine\adv_data_analytics> git pull origin master
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From https://github.com/pegblaine/adv_data_analytics
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
C:\Users\GBTC406003ur\Documents\pegblaine\adv_data_analytics>

In my local folder, this created a .git folder and downloaded the 2 files that exist in the repo

So this all worked correctly

Now I can create local copies of the other existing repositories that exist on my https://github.com/pegblaine workspace

In the pegblaine folder, add a folder for the each repo, cd to that folder, 

repeat these commands within each folder

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/pegblaine/folderName
git pull origin master

--------------------------------------

After changes made to files in local folder, push them to the correct repository on git hub



git add .
git commit -m "revised files"
git push -u origin master
